## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The reason for this bot is as follows.
It is important to have some level of a digital footprint that let people know more about you, this is important for employers, friends, and family members. But as we should know by now, having an active digital presence can also be a liability in that some things that you may post can be inadvertently inappropriate. There is also the chance that you do not post anything in generally, leading to a very small footprint. These are issues that go beyond the security risks of overusing social media.

As a person that tries their best to not use social media platforms more than necessary, I would still like friends, family members, and employers to know what I am interested in, I also feel that there are others in the same position.

This bot will help to accomplish this be allowing the user to input interests, and allow the bot to automate their twitter account by retweeting, following people with similar interests, and liking specifically tagged posts.

This accomplishes growing a digital footprint, while also keeping personal details from being overly shared online.

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot is set up in a way that it will like, retweet, and follow anyone that posts a photo or tweet that is accompanied by a specific hash tag. 

The bot also allow the user to post as normal.
